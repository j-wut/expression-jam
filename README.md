# expression-jam

A Clojure library designed to generate expression trees, and evaluate trees for use in whatever context you would like.

Main goals of this package are:
1. allow callers to pass parameters to customize tree generation:
  - characters to treat as separators
  - characters to treat as operators
  - order of operations
  - enclosures ie: "",'',``,(),{},[]
  - line separators
1. evaluate trees by passing parameters:
  - operator to function mapping
